# PSR2BS: Pseudo-label Guided Sparse Regression for Hyperspectral Band Selection

## Description
This repository provides a MATLAB demo implementation of the PSR2BS (Pseudo-Label Guided Sparse Regression with Spectral and Spatial Regularization for Hyperspectral Band Selection).

The demo includes:
1. Core implementation of our PSR2BS band selection method
2. Script to run the demo on the Botswana dataset
3. Evaluation of selected bands using both KNN and SVM classifiers

## Dataset
The demo uses the **Botswana** hyperspectral dataset, which is publicly available at: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes
